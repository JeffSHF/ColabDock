# ColabDock
### Inverting AlphaFold2 structure prediction model for protein-protein docking with experimental restraints

ColabDock is a docking framework developed based on [ColabDesign](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabDesign.git). It is able to incorporate experimental restraints to generate accurate protein complex structure. For details, please refer to the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.04.547599).

Before running the code, please set the variables in the config.py file according to the descriptive information.
